Get_Wordsense
=====
The whole idea of word sense is controversial. The meaning of a word is highly contextual and depends on its usage in sentence.

English is very difficult language to learn by robot as a lot of words are Ambiguous( Word with diffrent meanings). 

To solve this state-of-the-art problem, we have implemented the solution using Knowledge-Based Method ,
which concerned with identifying which sense of a word is used in a sentence.


Install
====

```
pip3 install -U nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')

```

'a financial institution that accepts deposits and channels the money into lending activities'
